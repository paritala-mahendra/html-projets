 An éclair is an oblong pastry made with choux dough filled with a cream and topped with chocolate icing. 
 The dough, which is the same as that used for profiterole, is typically piped into an oblong shape
           with a pastry bag
  and baked until it is crisp
 and hollow inside.
 Once cool, the pastry is then filled with a vanilla-, coffee- or chocolate-flavoured[1] 
           custard (crème pâtissière), or with whipped cream,
 or chiboust cream; and then iced with fondant icing.[1] Other fillings include pistachio-
           and rum-flavoured custard,
fruit-flavoured fillings,
 or chestnut purée.
 The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob
