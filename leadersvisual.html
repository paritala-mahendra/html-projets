        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/;[3] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)
        was an Indian lawyer,[4] anti-colonial nationalist,[5] and political ethicist,[6] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from
        British Rule,[7] and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
        The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world

        Alluri Sitarama Raju (1897 or 1898 – 7 May 1924) was a Telugu Indian revolutionary involved in the Indian independence movement.
        After the passing of the 1882 Madras Forest Act,
        its restrictions on the free movement of tribal people in the forest prevented them from engaging in their traditional podu agricultural system,
        which involved shifting cultivation. Raju led the Rampa Rebellion of 1922–24, during which a band of tribal people and other sympathisers fought in the border areas of the East Godavari and Visakhapatnam regions of Madras Presidency, in present-day Andhra Pradesh, against the British Raj,
        which had passed the law. He was referred to as "Manyam Veerudu" ("Hero of the Jungle") by the local people.
