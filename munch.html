        Munch is a chocolate bar manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and sold in the United States.
        The bar was introduced in 1970 as the Snickers Munch Peanut Brittle Bar[1] and was later relabeled "Munch". 
        It is made of only seven ingredients: peanuts, sugar, butter, corn syrup, palm oil, salt and soy lecithin.

        The candy bar contains no chocolate and is comparable to peanut brittle,
        though the Munch bar has a higher density of peanuts compared to most brittles.

        Due to its short list of simple ingredients, it is marketed as being healthy and natural
